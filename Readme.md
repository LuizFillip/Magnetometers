# EMBRACE Magnetometers Analysis

Magnetometer measures the strength and sometimes the direction of a magnetic field. An important use is the magnetometer for measuring the earth's magnetic field. By detecting irregularities in the Earth's magnetic field, a magnetometer may indicate the location of magnetic ore deposits such as iron ore, or geological formations associated with oil.

## Wavelet Analysis

Wavelet analysis is becoming a common tool for analyzing localized variations of power within a time series. By decomposing a time series into timeâ€“frequency space, one is able to determine both the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time (Torrence and Compo 1998).

### Phase Spectral

We can compute the wavelet phase by $\arctan(\Im(z), \Re(z))$
