# EMBRACE and INTERMAGNET magnetometers analysis 

See EMBRACE description: http://www2.inpe.br/climaespacial/portal/magnetometer-about/

Magnetometer measures the strength and sometimes the direction of a magnetic field. An important use is the magnetometer for measuring the earth's magnetic field. By detecting irregularities in the Earth's magnetic field, a magnetometer may indicate the location of magnetic ore deposits such as iron ore, or geological formations associated with oil.
